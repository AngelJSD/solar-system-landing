# Welcome to The solar system!

This is simple landing page built only using HTML, CSS and JS as a demonstratrion for the NASA Space Apps Challenge Arequipa

## Concept & CTA

This landing presents the Solar System as it were a product offered to aliens (customers) to find a new place to live. It contains short a description of each plannet with its characteristics and how it can be suitable for a special type of alien life

## Highlights

- The landing is responsive
- The first thing you see is the Sun rotating and an animated background with little dots representing stars
- The main content presents each plannet rotating on its edge that appear from right to left
- Each texture is fetched from a url and has a loading effect to improve user expereience (this was done in porpuse to demonstrate how to handle big images that need to be fetched for a server every time)
